##Trump wields first presidential veto 

**2019.03.16**. President Trump on friday used the first veto of his administration to reject a bipartisan resolution that sought to block his declaration of national emergency at the border, a move almost certain to kill the measure.

> "Today I am vetoing this resolution," Trump, surrounded by law enforcement officials and families of those killed by illegal immigrants, said in the Oval Office. "Congress has the freedom to pass tjis resolution and I have the duty to veto it"

This news shows the separation of powers in the United States. And we can see Trump is a very attractive person.
